# PuzzleCam — Gesture Capture
**© 2026 Waiz Hussain — all rights reserved**

A hand-gesture controlled photobooth puzzle game that runs entirely in your browser. No installation, no backend, no frameworks. Just your hands and a webcam.

---

## what is this?

You use your hands as a camera frame, pinch to take a photo, solve a puzzle with your fingers, and watch it shatter into a polaroid strip. The whole thing runs in one browser tab with zero setup.

Built with vanilla JavaScript, MediaPipe hand tracking, and the Web Audio API. No React. No npm. Nothing to install.

## how to play

| gesture | what it does |
|---|---|
| raise both hands | camera starts tracking your hands |
| pinch both hands together | defines the photo frame and starts 3 second countdown |
| one hand pinch on a piece | drag that puzzle piece |
| drop piece near correct spot | it snaps in automatically |
| closed fist (hold) | saves completed puzzle / resets board |

**the full flow:**
1. hold both hands up — the space between your index fingers becomes your camera frame
2. pinch both hands → 3 second countdown → flash → photo captured in B&W
3. solve the 3x3 puzzle by dragging pieces with a pinch gesture
4. make a fist when done → pieces shatter → saved as a color polaroid with your date and photo number
5. complete 3 puzzles → your full photo strip pops up → download it

- puzzles are **B&W while solving**, then reveal as **full color** when saved
- **camera flash** at the moment of capture
- **polaroid borders** with date and number stamped on each photo
- **sound design** — countdown beeps, piece snap, shatter burst, completion chime
- **video recording** of each solve, downloadable as WebM
- **photo strip popup** inside the game when all 3 are done
- zero frameworks, zero dependencies, everything runs in the browser
